## 🌟 **Introduction**  
Hello! I'm **Owais Iqbal**, a data analytics student. This project, part of my coursework for the **Carey Found Data Analytics Program**, explores influenza mortality trends across U.S. states and age groups (2009–2017). The goal is to uncover actionable insights for healthcare policymakers and researchers.

## 🔍 **Analysis Overview**  
### **Key Visualizations**  
- **Histogram of Deaths by Age Group**: Highlighted the **75–84 age group** as the most vulnerable.  
- **Bubble Chart of Top 5 States**: Identified **California, Texas, and New York** as high-mortality states.  
- **Heatmap**: Revealed temporal trends linking deaths to population density over time.  
- **Geographic Map**: Visualized spatial distribution of mortality rates across the U.S.  

### **Critical Insights**  
1. **State-Level Trends**:  
   - California, Texas, and New York consistently reported the highest mortality rates.  
2. **Age Group Trends**:  
   - The **75–84 age group** had the highest death count, emphasizing the need for elderly care programs.  
3. **Temporal Patterns**:  
   - Seasonal influenza outbreaks correlated with spikes in mortality data.

## 🚀 **Recommendations**  
1. **Prioritize Funding**: Allocate healthcare resources to high-mortality states (CA, TX, NY).  
2. **Elderly Care Initiatives**: Develop targeted preventive care for the **75–84 age group**.  
3. **Collaborative Research**: Investigate socio-economic, environmental, and healthcare factors driving trends.
